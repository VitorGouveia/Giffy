## Projects

Basically, Giffy is split up in two parts, one part contains all the apps and the other part contains all the building block of these apps

|Workspace|Description|
|------|-----------|
|[packages](#project-packages)|All the building blocks of the apps(styling, components, common logic, etc)|
|[apps](#project-apps)|All the apps that Giffy will have, mobile, desktop, website, etc|

<br />

<h3 id="project-packages">Packages</h3>

|Folder|Description|
|------|-----------|
|[styles](#styles-guide)| All the css code, follow a guide for that in [here](#styles-guide)|
|[ui](#ui-guide)|All the React UI components, follow a guide for that in [here](#ui-guide)|


<br />

<h3 id="project-apps">Apps</h3>

|Folder|Description|
|------|-----------|
|[web](#web-guide)| A Next.js web app, follow a guide for that in [here](#web-guide)|

<br />

<h2 id="styles-guide">Styles Guide</h2>

This a package composed of Sass and PostCSS plugins, it contains the whole css of the apps,

<h3 id="styles-guide-development">Development</h3>

to start developing in styles, run the development server:

`yarn dev` - this will start sass
`yarn compile:dev` - this will start postcss

to develop for any of the other packages, you **need** to run _both_ of the scripts

<br />

<h2 id="ui-guide">UI Guide</h2>

**This package depends on `Styles` to be running**, so make sure you [start that](#styles-guide-development) first

This a package composed of:

- Storybook - for the preview of the components
- Babel - to compile all our react code into minified javascript

<h3 id="ui-guide-development">Development</h3>

to start developing in ui, run the development server:

`yarn storybook` - this will start storybook and open your browser on the components page

<h3 id="ui-guide-build">Build</h3>

to build it, just run:

`yarn build` - this will build all the components into javascript


<br />

<h2 id="ui-guide">Web Guide</h2>

<h3>This package depends on UI to be built, so make sure you <a href="#ui-guide-build">build that</a> first</h3>

This is a package composed of:
- Next.js - the whole thing

<h3>Be aware that, this will not work as of today because I still need to find a way to prefix React Classnames in the UI lib, sorry :/</h3>
to start developing in Web, run the development server:

```
yarn dev
```
